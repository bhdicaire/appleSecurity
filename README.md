# Apple Security Guides

Apple takes security seriously, and their efforts are reflected in regularly updated publications:
* [Apple Platform Security](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/security/welcome/web)
 * [Personal Safety User Guide for Apple devices](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/personal-safety/welcome/web)

Unfortunately, it's harder to access previous editions thus I'm archiving them in this repository.
